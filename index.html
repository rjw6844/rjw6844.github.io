    <p>Given a week of vacation and a strong affinity to seeing critters, my dive buddy Analou and I decided to make Cozumel our first scuba destination as a couple.  We had heard about
    how many dives and different reefs Cozumel had to offer from our diving friend Kelly in San Antonio.  Due to a hurricane cancelling a trip to Cabo San Lucas, he and his partner David and another dive buddy Mike joined us in our mayhem.  Kelly is holding the shirt in the second photo from the left.  He also recommended <a href="http://www.papahogs.com/site/diving.php" target="_blank">Papahogs Dive Emporium</a> as a well
    run place.  We investigated several other dive operators and found the price and reputation made the decision easy.  We were not disappointed.</p>
    <p>It had been nearly ten years since I dove in the ocean so we wanted to do an easy dive first.  Instead of listening to us, our divemaster took us to ambiguiously sounding <a href="http://www.reefsofcozumel.com/tormentos.html" target="_blank">Tormentos reef</a>.  It was truely amazing with the coral formations.
    We also saw our first sea turtle.  Our second dive was close to where the cruise ships dock.  It was called Paradise Reef.  We dove there again later that day for a truely amazing night dive with Blanca from <a href="http://www.blueprojectcozumel.com/" target="_blank">Blue Project Cozumel</a>.  She showed us the thrill of diving without our dive lights
    turned on and seeing the bioluminescent plankton in the deep.
    </p>
    <p>My trip totalled 15 dives over six days of diving.  The two most memorable were the <a href="http://www.reefsofcozumel.com/shipwreckc53.html" target="_blank">C53 Wreck</a> and the <a href="http://www.reefsofcozumel.com/puntasur.html" target="_blank">Punta Sur or "Devil's Throat"</a>.
    The C-53 is a purposely sunk former Mexican Coast Guard ship which is home to schools of fish and most notibly a very long green eel.  We saw the eel while swimming through the galley.  Once we spotted it, torpedo legs ensued.</p>
    <p>Devils Throat was an anxiety inducing challenge.  The boat ride to the site was filled with fear and nervousness. Once in the water, however, it was exhilarating.  We had to swim a considerable distance that used up a third of our air.  The cave begins at 80 feet and eventually spits you out at 135 feet.  I will never forget the bluest water at the exit.  I hope to see it again.</p>
    <p>I put together the following videos and posted them on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPwG3o5AX9wwR7giEdUxEXCm8etDOyUn" target="_blank">Youtube</a> channel.  I am the guy waving at the camera in the La Francesca video.
